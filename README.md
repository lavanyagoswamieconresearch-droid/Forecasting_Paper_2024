**Abstract**:
This paper endeavors to forecast trends in countries' renewable energy shares 
relative to total energy consumption, encompassing a diverse selection based 
on geographical, economic, and climatic factors. Employing an ARIMA model with 
Fourier transformation, we elucidate autocorrelation dynamics within the system, 
effectively addressing structural breaks and seasonality.

The STATA code achieves the following: 
The Stata code in this file performs a time-series econometrics analysis for multiple countries (India, Germany, United States, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, and South Africa) to model and forecast the share of renewable energy (`renewable_share`).

For each country, the script executes the following key steps:
1. Filters the dataset to the target country, sets the time identifier, and creates a time trend variable
2. Constructs smooth seasonal or cyclical terms to capture underlying structural breaks or cycles
3. Conducts Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root tests and its first difference to check for non-stationarity
4. Estimates an initial OLS linear regression using lagged values, Fourier components, and economic/energy covariates 
5. Analyzes the baseline model's residuals using autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and ARIMASOC 
6. Computes predicted values, extracts residuals, and evaluates whether the residuals approximate white noise using Portmanteau tests and correlograms
7. Plots the actual values of against fitted/predicted values to visually inspect model accuracy
